Blocks
     Storage blocks for all materials
     Squidifier and budderfier (turn all Budder/squid blocks into own type, eg. Budder -> squid for squidifier)
     Spinning wheel (turn wheat into string (or Budder with Rumplestiltskin))
     Budder/squid accumulator (VERY slowly generates Budder/squid)
     Duplicator (duplicates an item in return for 1 and a half of that item worth or derp)
     Force/Derp-o-meter (detects force/derp)
     Lots of butter equivalents of vanilla blocks
     Force field emitters (will be connectable and upgradable)
     Force field block (the block for a force field) (transparent, and similar to a portal, but solid)
     Computer (a bit like a ComputerCraft computer, but less coding and more fun orientated) (limited amount of data space)
     Server (stores loads of data, but have to be linked to a computer to access data)
     Aerials/satellite dishes (send/receive signals on a chosen frequency) (must be connected to server or computer)
     Teleporter (uses derp as power) (can be arranged 1x1 or 2x2) (2x2 requires more power, but can go further and transport more)
     Derp pipe/wire (different types for blocks/items, liquids, derp, or data from computers) (modes: extract, insert, simple, redirect, TELEPORT (requires derp))
     Derp generator v1 (basicly an auto cobblestone generator, which uses picks) (gens 1 cobble worth of derp at the speed of the pick on cobble) (will be crafted with water and lava an other stuff)

     Diving gear
     More Budder stuff (like tools and armour)
     Screwdriver (used to open computers/servers/aerials for upgrade/fixing)
